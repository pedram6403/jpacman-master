/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of the classic Pac-Man ghost Clyde.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Pokey needs a new nickname because out of all the ghosts,
 * Clyde is the least likely to "C'lyde" with Pac-Man. Clyde is always the last
 * ghost out of the regenerator, and the loner of the gang, usually off doing
 * his own thing when not patrolling the bottom-left corner of the maze. His
 * behavior is very random, so while he's not likely to be following you in hot
 * pursuit with the other ghosts, he is a little less predictable, and still a
 * danger.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>AI:</b> Clyde has two basic AIs, one for when he's far from Pac-Man, and
 * one for when he is near to Pac-Man. 
 * When Clyde is far away from Pac-Man (beyond eight grid spaces),
 * Clyde behaves very much like Blinky, trying to move to Pac-Man's exact
 * location. However, when Clyde gets within eight grid spaces of Pac-Man, he
 * automatically changes his behavior and runs away.
 * </p>
